          <p>Each round of the competition requires the candidate to explore and communicate what they care about, why they care and how they plan to make a difference if empowered financially.</p>

          <p>The Founders of Charitable Heroes personally guarantee that the winner will be able to give away $300 each year for their rest of their lives. How do we do this? It's simple, every year, Mike Hurley, Matt Stelmaszek and Mark Spiegel (the Founders) each make a personal deposit of $100 into the Charitable Heroes, L3C bank account and the winner of the competition works with the Founders to give this $300 away to a cause, organization or person they care about. </p>

           <p>All registration fees are kept inside Charitable Heroes, L3C to cover the expenses (time material and technology) required to provide this great educational experience via the competition. </p>

          <p>The selection process occurs throughout the course of the competition over three rounds. During each round a judge is assigned to Candidates. The submission of the candidate is scored during each round on a scale of 0-100 and feedback is provided by the judge. Candidates are eliminated after each round and one winner is chosen.</p>
