          <b>Round One</b>
          <p>Charitable Heroes is colloborating with a New York venture called Ziggeo to make this a fun, sucessful round one. When it's time for round one, we will notify everyone via email to invite you to upload a two minute video telling us who you are, where you're from, and the person, cause or organization you want to help today.</p>
          <p>Charitable Heroes will ask you if you are okay with us sharing your video. If so, we share your video on our YouTube channel for everyone to vote on. A combination of public votes and our judges reviews will decide who moves onto round two. A combination of Charitable Heroes founders, volunteers and judges will individually review every video submitted. A maximum of 1000 entries will move on to round two. Read more about what we are looking for here.</p>
          <br/>
          <b>Round Two</b>
          <p>This round requires a deep dive into the cause, organization or person you desire to help. We again ask you to we provide a link for you to asnwer these questions via an online form. Our judges will invidividually review all submissions and score individauls. A maximum of 100 entrants will move onto round three.</p>

          <summary>What do I get if I win?</summary>
          <b>Your Superpowers</b>
          <p>Our competition awards one winner with "charitable superpowers" - which we define as: The ability to give away money every year, to any cause, person or ogranization where it creates a positive impact regardless of your personal financial status." Here is how we plant to create your charitable superpowers, we've dreamed up two scenarios, one small, the another of epic proportions. The order of magnitude of your power is determined by the number of entrants the competition finds, so we need your help! Applicant entry fees build a pool of money which is managed to never be spent down (similar to an endowment).</P>

          <p>Our first milestone is to reach 775 entrants or raise roughly $23,000. If this occurs the winner will have the ability to give away $500 every year for the rest of their lives.</p>

          <p>To reach legend status we need to gather 50,000 people to the competition, raising roughly 1.5M. If we hit this goal, the charitable hero will have the ability to give away $30,000 every year for the rest of their lives. Imagine the people or organizations you could help with that kind of power? Who would you help? What changes would you make to your community? In either case, we are excited to empower one winner financially, and to empower everyone else with a deeper knowledge of what matters to them, and how they can make a difference.</p>
