          <p>Each round of the competition requires the candidate to explore and communicate what they care about, why they care and how they plan to make a difference if empowered financially.</p>
          <p>The Founders of Charitable Heroes personally guarantee that the winner will be able to give away $300 each year for their rest of their lives. How do we do this? It's simple, every year, Mike Hurley, Matt Stelmaszek and Mark Spiegel (the Founders) each make a personal deposit of $100 into the Charitable Heroes, L3C bank account and the winner of the competition works with the Founders to give this $300 away to a cause, organization or person they care about. </p>
          <p>All registration fees are kept inside Charitable Heroes, L3C to cover the expenses (time material and technology) required to provide this great educational experience via the competition. </p>
          <p>The selection process occurs throughout the course of the competition over three rounds. During each round a judge is assigned to Candidates. The submission of the candidate is scored during each round on a scale of 0-100 and feedback is provided by the judge. Candidates are eliminated after each round and one winner is chosen.</p>

          <summary>What makes your approach to philanthropy different?</summary>
          <p>Our winner can provide financial support (via gift, investment or purchase) to almost any entity type (public, private or hybrid). This is different from the traditional philanthropist using a donor advised fund. Often, a young  adult may look to start a donor advised fund but this limits how they can provide support. Today's challenges are often complicated and require a philanthropic approach which is more open-minded and unencumbered.</p>
          <p>We like to think of our winner as a Charitable Hero because they will be different than other mere philanthropists - unencumbered by bureacracy or financial burden.</p>

          <summary>How do you educate entrants?</summary>
          <p>The three rounds of the competition include an educational activity. Round one requires the entrant to introduce themselves via a video submission where they must first mention their chosen cause. This is designed to be an ice-breaker but forces the participant to make a decision to focus on one cause.</p>
          <p>Round two requires the participant to answer ten (10) in-depth questions regarding the who, what, when, where and why about their chosen cause. Similar to competing in a business plan competition, we push our participants to research and articulate how they want help their cause.</p>
          <p>Round three is an interview with our judges where we ask tailored questions. The interview process requires the participant to answer new questions and consider feedback from our judges and founders.</p>
          <p>One winner receives a life-long educational experience. Charitable Heroes will work annually with the winner to annually draft a short impact plan and provide annual support them. We look forward to watching their philanthropy change as their values and life changes and supporting them along the way.</p>
          <p>Our ultimate goal is for all participants to come away with a deeper understanding and desire to support their presented cause(s).</p>
